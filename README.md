**Hangman**

A simple player versus computer game of Hangman where Serialization is used to allow the player to save a game file, and access it at a later date. 

**Demo**

**Features**
Load and Save files for future use

**How to use**
Go to https://replit.com/@mgrig92/hangman#hangman.rb and into the console type in *ruby hangman.rb*

**Possible future additions**
-Allow user to dictate the names of the saved/loaded files, so that more than 1 file can be saved at a time.

**Known Bugs**
-Typing in the same wrong letter multiple times counts as wrong guesses.

**Reflections**
Serialization was definitely an intimidated topic to tackle, but I'm happy with how this project came out. My biggest self-criticizm is the way the code is organized. I dislike the fact that I used only a single class, though I'm not sure what I could have done differently. I'm beginning to read 99 Bottles of OOP, which will hopefully help me make my code more organized and readable in future projects.
